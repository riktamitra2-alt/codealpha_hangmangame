#task one:: Hangman Game Goal: Create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time. Simplified Scope: ● Use a small list of 5 predefined words (no need to use a file or API). ● Limit incorrect guesses to 6. ● Basic console input/output — no graphics or audio.
